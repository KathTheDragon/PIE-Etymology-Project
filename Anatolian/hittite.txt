# Note on Transcription
Several liberties have been taken with the spelling of Hittite, Palaic, and Cuneiform Luwian forms in bound transcription. Firstly, the letters _š_ and _ḫ_ have been replaced with _s_ and _h_. Secondly, the distinction between _p_, _t_, and _k_, on the one hand, and _b_, _d_, and _g_, on the other, has been collapsed in favour of the voiceless stops, as I know of no functional contrast that employs these spellings.

Hieroglyphic Luwian forms are given in unbound transcription.

# Word classes
Verbs have been annotated with the form of the 3sg present corresponding to their inflection class: [zi v] for _mi_-conjugation, [i v] for _hi_-conjugation, [ari v] for a dentalless middle, and [ttari v] for a dental middle. Nouns are annotated with their gender: [c n] for common and [n n] for neuter.

\notes The allative case marks a _goal_ ("place to which"), rather than a direction, for which see Melchert (2017). Hence, against EDHIL, it cannot be compared with the local adverbs in _-a_ (in particular, _parā_ "forwards" and _sarā_ "upwards") to be reconstructed \*-o. Instead, with Melchert, the ending is to be reconstructed \*-eh₂ (thematic \*-oh₂) with regular loss of \*h₂ word-finally.

Kloekhorst suggests that the neuter plural _=e_ could be from \*-ih₂, with a comparable lowering to \*-uh₂ > /-o/ in _assū_ "good", but I'm unconvinced by his examples. Moreover, Jasanoff has to my mind convincingly explained it from \*-oy, with the pronominal neuter plural stem in \*oy found in the oblique.
