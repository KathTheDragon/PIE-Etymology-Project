# Note on Transcription
Several liberties have been taken with the spelling of Hittite, Palaic, and Cuneiform Luwian forms in bound transcription. Firstly, the letters _š_ and _ḫ_ have been replaced with _s_ and _h_. Secondly, the distinction between _p_, _t_, and _k_, on the one hand, and _b_, _d_, and _g_, on the other, has been collapsed in favour of the voiceless stops, as I know of no functional contrast that employs these spellings. Plene vowels are written with a macron (_ā_), while hyper-plene vowels are written with a circumflex (_â_). Intervocalic _i_ and _u/ú_ will typically be written as _y_ and _w_ unless there is good reason to read them otherwise.

Hieroglyphic Luwian forms are generally given in unbound transcription due to the difficulties of determining their phonetic form. When a phonetic form is given, it is between slashes (/.../).

# Word classes
Verbs have been annotated with the form of the 3sg present corresponding to their inflection class: `zi v` for _mi_-conjugation, `i v` for _hi_-conjugation, `ari v` for a dentalless middle, and `ttari v` for a dental middle. Nouns are annotated with their gender: `c n` for common and `n n` for neuter.

\notes The allative case marks a _goal_ ("place to which"), rather than a direction, for which see Melchert (2017). Hence, against EDHIL, it cannot be compared with the local adverbs in _-a_ (in particular, _parā_ "forwards" and _sarā_ "upwards") to be reconstructed \*-o. Instead, with Melchert, the ending is to be reconstructed \*-eh₂ (thematic \*-oh₂) with regular loss of \*h₂ word-finally.

Kloekhorst suggests that the neuter plural _=e_ could be from \*-ih₂, with a comparable lowering to \*-uh₂ > /-o/ in _assū_ "good", but I'm unconvinced by his examples. Moreover, Jasanoff has to my mind convincingly explained it from \*-oy, with the pronominal neuter plural stem in \*oy found in the oblique of o-stem pronouns. The clitic itself could be a reflex of PIE \*h₁e-, but it's impossible to say for certain.

\gloss to be hot
\notes The certain forms of this verb are 3s.prs.mid. _âri_, _āri_, 3p.prs.mid. _ânta_, and participle _ânt-_, _ānt-_, and the causative _[inuzzi]_. EDHIL further connects a 3p.prs.act. form _ayissanzi_ of apparently uncertain meaning, assuming that this is writing _ayessanzi_ "to become hot", and also a 3s.prt.mid. form _ayittat_, also of uncertain meaning, but I would prefer not to make such assumptions. Even still, their reconstruction of Pre-Hittite \*āyari is plausible. Further etymology is unclear.

\notes Following Melchert (2010), I reconstruct this word and its cognates as dir.sg. \*h₁óh₁s, oblique \*h₁(e)h₁s-. The Hittite dir.sg. with an _i_ is due to anaptyxis of PAnat \*e in \*-h₁s# (PAnat \*h₁óh₁es > CLuw. /ā.as/, Pre-Hitt. /ā.is/ regularly), while the oblique (and derivative stem) with _ss_ is due to assimilation of \*h₁s after an unaccented vowel.

\notes Following Melchert (2012), Kloekhorst's (2008) account of this verb is impossible - short \*ó did not lenite a following stop. Rather, we should reckon with analogical extension of the _-āCi_ ~ _-aCCanzi_ pattern due to the abberant allomorphy of \*_nākki_ ~ _akkanzi_ \< \*nóḱey ~ \*n̩ḱénti. Why this repair was chosen over a paradigm \*_nākki_ ~ \*_nakkanzi_ or \*_ākki_ ~ \*_akkanzi_ is beyond me, however.
