# Note on Transcription
Several liberties have been taken with the spelling of Hittite, Palaic, and Cuneiform Luwian forms in bound transcription. Firstly, the letters _š_ and _ḫ_ have been replaced with _s_ and _h_. Secondly, the distinction between _p_, _t_, and _k_, on the one hand, and _b_, _d_, and _g_, on the other, has been collapsed in favour of the voiceless stops, as I know of no functional contrast that employs these spellings. Plene vowels are written with a macron (_ā_), while hyper-plene vowels are written with a circumflex (_â_). Intervocalic _i_ and _u/ú_ will typically be written as _y_ and _w_ unless there is good reason to read them otherwise. _u_ and _ú_ will be kept distinct where possible as _o_ and _ú_ (with _u_ used for when the quality of the vowel cannot be determined).

Hieroglyphic Luwian forms are generally given in unbound transcription due to the difficulties of determining their phonetic form. When a phonetic form is given, it is between slashes (/.../).

# Word classes
Verbs have been annotated with the form of the 3sg present corresponding to their inflection class: `zi v` for _mi_-conjugation, `i v` for _hi_-conjugation, `ari v` for a dentalless middle, and `ttari v` for a dental middle. Nouns are annotated with their gender: `c n` for common and `n n` for neuter.

\notes The allative case marks a _goal_ ("place to which"), rather than a direction, for which see Melchert (2017). Hence, against EDHIL, it cannot be compared with the local adverbs in _-a_ (in particular, _parā_ "forwards" and _sarā_ "upwards") to be reconstructed \*-o. Instead, with Melchert, the ending is to be reconstructed \*-eh₂ (thematic \*-oh₂) with regular loss of \*h₂ word-finally.

\gloss _imperfective_?
\base -ātar
\notes This suffix is claimed to be equivalent to the other two imperfective suffixes, _[-skezzi]_ and _[-ssai]_, and that all three function as suppletive allomorphs. Upon examining the verbs listed as showing this suffix in Kloekhorst (2008), which are given below, I must question this assertion - just about every deverbal case of _-annai_ occurs alongside a _-skezzi_ imperfective which is often as old or older attested, and in several cases shows a clearly archaic formation (e.g. _zaskezzi_ "be putting" to _tāi_ "put", next to _tiyannai_ "lay down"). Moreover, several of the verbs in _-annai_ are also found extended with the _-skezzi_ imperfective themselves (and a few are only found in the imperfective).

In formal terms, the suffix inflects according to the _mēmai_ class with mixed _a_- and _i_-stem inflection, which originally derives from the _tāi_ class, for which see Spence (2021). Kloekhorst (2008) connects this suffix with the _[-ātar]_ suffix, which see for further etymology. The verbs containing the suffix can be divided into several groups. Most numerous are those attached to a verbal base, four of which occur beside a productive or lexicalised verbal noun:
- _[hattannai]_ "to pierce" < _[hattari]_ "to pierce"
- _[hukannai]_ "to conjure" < _[huekzi]_ "to conjure", _[hūkatar]_ "conjouring"
- _[huttiyannai]_ "to pull" < _[huettiyezzi]_ "to pull"
- _[iyannai]_ "to march" < _[iyattari]_ "to go"
- _[ishuwannai]_ "to throw" < _[ishuwāi]_ "to throw"
- _[iskarannai]_ "to sting" < _[iskāri]_ "to sting", _[iskaratar]_ "sting(?)"
- _[sippantannai]_ "to libate" < _[ispānti]_ "to libate"
- _[isparannai]_ "to spread" < _[ispāri]_ "to spread (out)"
- _[lahhiyannai]_ "to travel" < _[lahhiyezzi]_ "to travel", _[lahhiyatar]_ "campaign"
- _[piyannai]_ "to give" < _[pāi]_ "to give", _[\*piyatar]_ "giving"
- _[parhannai]_ "to chase" < _[parhzi]_ "to chase"
- _[parsiyannai]_ "to break" < _[parsiyari]_ "to break"
- _[pessiyannai]_ "to throw away" < _[pessiyezzi]_ "to throw away"
- _[pittannai]_ "to bring" < _[pittaezzi]_ "to bring"
- _[tiyannai]_ "to lay down" < _[tāi]_ "to put"
- _[tuhsannai]_ "to cut off" < _[tuhsari]_ "to cut off"
- _[walhannai]_ "to hit" < _[walhzi]_ "to hit"
- _[weriyannai]_ "to call" < _[weriyezzi]_ "to call"
Those derived from ablauting verbs display the zero-grade of the base, while the non-ablauting verbs show the single base stem.

Another example is clearly derived from a lexicalised verbal noun, rather than the base verb:
- _taksanna/i-_ "to level" < _[taksatar]_ "plain, level" < _[takkiszi]_ "to put together"

A single verb is apparently derived directly from a noun, but there may be an unattested underlying verb, given that _halukas_ looks like a zero-grade a-stem, a common deverbal formation:
- _[halukannai]_ "to bring news" < _[halukas]_ "message"

Lastly are a few with an unknown base:
- _[hallannai]_ "to trample down(?)"
- _[sallannai]_ "to pull"

It seems quite likely that in all of these cases, there is an underlying verb that originally produced a verbal noun in _-ātar_, from which all of these verbs were then derived.

\notes This verb does not show the expected ablaut between singular and plural forms, instead having a uniform stem _āns-_ until later times, which implies levelling.

A cluster \*mHs may be sufficient, but there do not appear to be any parallels. Kloekhorst assumes the verb comes from \*h₂ómh₁s-, related to Greek _amáō_ "to mow" and Germanic \*mēaną "to mow", but this requires the sound law \*H > \*ʔ before \*o, which I am reluctant to accept (and also note the abbrant vowel placement - \*s extensions trigger Schwebeablaut to the right, not the left). In the absence of a good understanding of the Luwian form, I will reserve judgement on the origin of this verb.

With Melchert (2009a), and against Kloekhorst (2008), these are not synchronically case-forms of an otherwise unattested noun \*\*_āpp(a)-_. Also against Kloekhorst (2008), local adverbs very much could be stressed, and the Hittite word must be read as /ˈaːppa/. The Hieroglyphic Luwian form _á-pi_ indicates the original form of the adverb ended in \*i, thus all these words reflect Proto-Anatolain \*ʔópi. Per Melchert (2009b) The final _-a_ of the Hittite and Luwian words can be due to influence from \*pró > _[parā]_ "forth, towards" (though Luwian only attests _parī_ "forth, away").

Greek _ópistʰen_ "(from) behind, at the back, after(wards)", representing \*_ópi_ with the ablative suffix _-tʰen_, is the best semantic match for _āppa_. This \*_ópi_ is the o-grade variant of Greek _épi_ "on, at", Sanskrit _ápi_ "also, further, even", and Armenian _ew_ "also, and", with the o-grade also found in Latin _ob_ "towards; with regard to" and Lithuanian _apiẽ_ "around, about". To my mind, all of these senses can be unified in PIE \*h₁épi ~ \*h₁ópi "to/at/on the back", with "at the back" > "behind" and "at", "to the back" > "backwards", and "on the back" > "upon" > "also". Strictly not to be connected with PIE \*h₂(e)pó, which denotes "away from" rather than "behind, backwards".

\base āppa
\notes _āppan_ is a locatival adverb, paired with _[āppa]_ "backwards" in Hittite's synchronic system of local adverbs (compare _[anta]_ "into" ~ _[antan]_ "inside"). With Melchert (2009) and against Kloekhorst (2008), these are not synchronically case-forms of an otherwise unattestd noun \*\*āpp(a)-. Like _[āppa]_, the plene _ā_ does denote a synchronically long stressed vowel, so the word must be read as /ˈaːppan/. The Luwic words indicate that the formation goes back to Proto-Anatolian, though as there is no external comparanda, it could be a Proto-Anatolian analogy to \*ʔn̩dóm/n "inside".

Sanskrit _áram_ "fittingly") despite the appealing semantics. Bengtson (2016) connects this family of words to his proposed nominal root \*h₁er- "member of one's own clan" > "free man", which would trivially explain the semantics of "freedom" in _[arāwas]_ "free (from)" and its derivatives.

EDHIL further connects a 3p.prs.act. form _ayissanzi_ of apparently uncertain meaning, assuming that this is writing _ayessanzi_ "to become hot", and also a 3s.prt.mid. form _ayittat_, also of uncertain meaning, but I would prefer not to make such assumptions. Even still, their reconstruction of Pre-Hittite \*āyari is plausible. Further etymology is unclear.

\from:pie h₁r̩tó "has reached" or h₃r̩tó "has risen"
\notes Kloekhorst (2008) connects this verb with the middle root aorist of PIE \*h₃er- "to rise" (e.g. Greek _õrto_ "has risen"), which works well semantically and explains the middle inflection. However, I'm unconvinced that his rule of \*h₃r- \> \*ʔr \> _ar-_ (cf. _[arāi]_ "to rise" < \*h₃ri-) should work with syllabic \*r̩, which would be present in all forms outside the 3pl \*h₃rénto (unless we assume the 3sg \*-to is secondary for \*-o here). This 3pl may or may not be sufficient basis for generalising \*ʔ- across the paradigm. The alternative, \*h₁er- "to come to, reach" (cf. _[āri]_ "to come (to)"), is semantically more awkward (although "has reached" \> "is standing still" isn't implausible), and the root appears to only make active verbs elsewhere.

Kloekhorst suggests that the neuter plural _=e_ could be from \*-ih₂, with a comparable lowering to \*-uh₂ > /-o/ in _assū_ "good", but I'm unconvinced by his examples. Moreover, Jasanoff has to my mind convincingly explained it from \*-oy, with the pronominal neuter plural stem in \*oy found in the oblique of o-stem pronouns. The clitic itself could be a reflex of PIE \*h₁e-, but it's impossible to say for certain.

The Hittite dir.sg. with an _i_ is due to anaptyxis of PAnat \*e in \*-h₁s# (PAnat \*h₁óh₁es > CLuw. /ā.as/, Pre-Hitt. /ā.is/ regularly), while the oblique (and derivative stem) with _ss_ is due to assimilation of \*h₁s after an unaccented vowel.
