# Note on Transcription
Several liberties have been taken with the spelling of Hittite, Palaic, and Cuneiform Luwian forms in bound transcription. Firstly, the letters _š_ and _ḫ_ have been replaced with _s_ and _h_. Secondly, the distinction between _p_, _t_, and _k_, on the one hand, and _b_, _d_, and _g_, on the other, has been collapsed in favour of the voiceless stops, as I know of no functional contrast that employs these spellings. Plene vowels are written with a macron (_ā_), while hyper-plene vowels are written with a circumflex (_â_). Intervocalic _i_ and _u/ú_ will typically be written as _y_ and _w_ unless there is good reason to read them otherwise.

Hieroglyphic Luwian forms are generally given in unbound transcription due to the difficulties of determining their phonetic form. When a phonetic form is given, it is between slashes (/.../).

# Word classes
Verbs have been annotated with the form of the 3sg present corresponding to their inflection class: `zi v` for _mi_-conjugation, `i v` for _hi_-conjugation, `ari v` for a dentalless middle, and `ttari v` for a dental middle. Nouns are annotated with their gender: `c n` for common and `n n` for neuter.

\notes The allative case marks a _goal_ ("place to which"), rather than a direction, for which see Melchert (2017). Hence, against EDHIL, it cannot be compared with the local adverbs in _-a_ (in particular, _parā_ "forwards" and _sarā_ "upwards") to be reconstructed \*-o. Instead, with Melchert, the ending is to be reconstructed \*-eh₂ (thematic \*-oh₂) with regular loss of \*h₂ word-finally.

Why this repair was chosen over a paradigm \*_nākki_ ~ \*_nakkanzi_ or \*_ākki_ ~ \*_akkanzi_ is beyond me, however.

\gloss _imperfective_?
\base -ātar
\notes This suffix is claimed to be equivalent to the other two imperfective suffixes, _[-skezzi]_ and _[-ssai]_, and that all three function as suppletive allomorphs. Upon examining the verbs listed as showing this suffix in Kloekhorst (2008), which are given below, I must question this assertion - just about every deverbal case of _-annai_ occurs alongside a _-skezzi_ imperfective which is often as old or older attested, and in several cases shows a clearly archaic formation (e.g. _zaskezzi_ "be putting" to _tāi_ "put", next to _tiyannai_ "lay down"). Moreover, several of the verbs in _-annai_ are also found extended with the _-skezzi_ imperfective themselves (and a few are only found in the imperfective). \
In formal terms, the suffix inflects according to the _mēmai_ class with mixed _a_- and _i_-stem inflection, which originally derives from the _tāi_ class, for which see Spence (2021). Kloekhorst (2008) connects this suffix with the _[-ātar]_ suffix, which see for further etymology. The verbs containing the suffix can be divided into several groups. Most numerous are those attached to a verbal base, four of which occur beside a productive or lexicalised verbal noun:
- _[hattannai]_ "to pierce" < _[hattari]_ "to pierce"
- _[hukannai]_ "to conjure" < _[huekzi]_ "to conjure", _[hūkatar]_ "conjouring"
- _[huttiyannai]_ "to pull" < _[huettiyezzi]_ "to pull"
- _[iyannai]_ "to march" < _[iyattari]_ "to go"
- _[ishuwannai]_ "to throw" < _[ishuwāi]_ "to throw"
- _[iskarannai]_ "to sting" < _[iskāri]_ "to sting", _[iskaratar]_ "sting(?)"
- _[sippantannai]_ "to libate" < _[ispānti]_ "to libate"
- _[isparannai]_ "to spread" < _[ispāri]_ "to spread (out)"
- _[lahhiyannai]_ "to travel" < _[lahhiyezzi]_ "to travel", _[lahhiyatar]_ "campaign"
- _[piyannai]_ "to give" < _[pāi]_ "to give", _[*piyatar]_ "giving"
- _[parhannai]_ "to chase" < _[parhzi]_ "to chase"
- _[parsiyannai]_ "to break" < _[parsiyari]_ "to break"
- _[pessiyannai]_ "to throw away" < _[pessiyezzi]_ "to throw away"
- _[pittannai]_ "to bring" < _[pittaezzi]_ "to bring"
- _[tiyannai]_ "to lay down" < _[tāi]_ "to put"
- _[tuhsannai]_ "to cut off" < _[tuhsari]_ "to cut off"
- _[walhannai]_ "to hit" < _[walhzi]_ "to hit"
- _[weriyannai]_ "to call" < _[weriyezzi]_ "to call"
Those derived from ablauting verbs display the zero-grade of the base, while the non-ablauting verbs show the single base stem.

Another example is clearly derived from a lexicalised verbal noun, rather than the base verb:
- _taksanna/i-_ "to level" < _[taksatar]_ "plain, level" < _[takkiszi]_ "to put together"

A single verb is apparently derived directly from a noun, but there may be an unattested underlying verb, given that _halukas_ looks like a zero-grade a-stem, a common deverbal formation:
- _[halukannai]_ "to bring news" < _[halukas]_ "message"

Lastly are a few with an unknown base:
- _[hallannai]_ "to trample down(?)"
- _[sallannai]_ "to pull"

It seems quite likely that in all of these cases, there is an underlying verb that originally produced a verbal noun in _-ātar_, from which all of these verbs were then derived.

Kloekhorst suggests that the neuter plural _=e_ could be from \*-ih₂, with a comparable lowering to \*-uh₂ > /-o/ in _assū_ "good", but I'm unconvinced by his examples. Moreover, Jasanoff has to my mind convincingly explained it from \*-oy, with the pronominal neuter plural stem in \*oy found in the oblique of o-stem pronouns. The clitic itself could be a reflex of PIE \*h₁e-, but it's impossible to say for certain.
